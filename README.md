## Introduction

NoxicCore is a *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.

The original core was derived from *ArcEmu*, and is based on the code of that project with
extensive changes over time to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase 
at the same time as improving the in-game mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
